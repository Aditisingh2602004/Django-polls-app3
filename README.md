Django Polls Application

Project Overview
This is a Django-based Polls Web Application developed as part of my learning and internship practice. The application allows users to view poll questions, vote on available choices, and see the results. It follows Django’s MVT (Model–View–Template) architecture and uses best practices like URL namespacing, templates, and ORM.

Features
- Display list of poll questions
- View poll details
- Vote on poll choices
- View poll results
- Secure form submission using CSRF
- Clean URL routing with namespacing
- Error handling using get_object_or_404
